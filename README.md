## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code supporting the manuscript:

> *Thirty-Five Years of Accelerating Heat Stress in Kenya: Subnational Hazard, Exposure Burden, And Vulnerability in Priority Populations*

We conducted a nationwide ecological panel study characterising heat hazard, exposure burden, and heat vulnerability across all 290 sub-counties of Kenya, focusing on **pregnant women**, **children under five**, and **adults aged 60 and older** (2015–2025), with extended climatological context from 1991 to 2025.

---

## Key Findings

- National population-weighted mean days exceeding 38°C (H38) increased significantly from 1991–2025 (Sen slope 0.97 days/year; *p* < 0.001), with record levels in 2024 and 2025.
- 61 sub-counties with sustained heat (≥30 days/year) account for ~96% of annual heat exposure burden across all priority groups.
- Heat exposure is **inversely associated with relative wealth** (Spearman ρ = −0.561; *p* < 0.001).
- Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) rankings are highly concordant for pregnant women and children under five (ρ = 0.977), with older adults showing additional priority in coastal transitional sub-counties.

## Analysis Script

The script [`analysis/climate_hvi_kenya.py`](analysis/climate_hvi_kenya.py) was developed in Google Colab using the **Google Earth Engine Python API** and covers:

- Extraction of age-stratified population denominators (elderly 60+, children 0–4, infants, women of reproductive age) per sub-county per year
- Calibration of estimated annual births and pregnancies using national anchor-year data
- Computation of sub-county WRA shares and interpolated calibration factors (κ and r)
- Export of zonal statistics as CSV and administrative boundaries as GeoJSON

### Running the Script

The script requires a Google Earth Engine account. To run:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install earthengine-api pandas numpy openpyxl

# 2. Authenticate with Earth Engine
earthengine authenticate

# 3. Run in Google Colab or a local environment
#    Update the project ID (currently "ee-felixxxxx") to your own GEE project
python analysis/climate_hvi_kenya.py
```

> **Note:** Replace `ee-felixxxxxx` with your own Google Earth Engine project ID before running.

## Outputs

The script generates the following CSV files:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `kenya_adm2_60plus_population_2015-2030.csv` | Total/female/male 60+ population per sub-county per year |
| `kenya_adm2_0_4_population_2015-2030.csv` | Total/female/male 0–4 population per sub-county per year |
| `kenya_adm2_infants_2015-2030.csv` | Infant (0–12 months) population per sub-county per year |
| `kenya_adm2_wra_2015-2030.csv` | Women of reproductive age (15–49) per sub-county per year |
| `kenya_subcounty_population_and_events_2015-2030.csv` | Combined: infants, WRA, estimated births & pregnancies |
| `kenya_adm2_boundaries_indexed.geojson` | ADM2 boundaries with `object_id` property |
